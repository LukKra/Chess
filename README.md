The aim of this project is to make a console game of chess understanding Polish chess algebraic notation. 
First input should be 'N' or 'Z'. 'N' begins a new game while 'Z' closes the program.
Then inputs for each move should be input following the Polish chess algebraic notation where:
K is king, H is queen, W is rook, G is bishop, S is knight.
